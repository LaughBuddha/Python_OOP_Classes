# Python_OOP_Classes
Learning OOPs in Python

I was just learning how to build classes in Python. This code is motivated from the Corey Schafer tutorial on YouTube.

Conepts learnt
 - Classes and Objects
 - __init__(self) //initializer/constructor
 - class methods and attributes
 - inheritance
 - dunder methods (__init__)
 - regular(self), class(cls), and static methods
 - @property decorator (to use method as an attribute)
